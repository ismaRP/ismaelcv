  abstract     = {Summary In the Middle Ages, texts were recorded and preserved
                  on parchment, an animal-derived material. When this resource
                  was scarce, older manuscripts were sometimes recycled to write
                  new manuscripts. In the process, the ancient text was erased,
                  creating what is known as a palimpsest. Here, we explore the
                  potential of peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF), widely applied
                  to identify species, to help reconnect the dispersed leaves of
                  a manuscript and reveal differences in parchment
                  manufacturing. In combination with visual methods, we analysed
                  a whole palimpsest, the codex AM 795 4to from the Arnamagnæan
                  Collection (Copenhagen, Denmark). We find that both sheep and
                  goat skins were used in this manuscript, and that parchment
                  differed in quality. Notably, the PMF analysis distinguished
                  five groups of folios which match the visual groupings. We
                  conclude that this detailed interrogation of a single mass
                  spectrum can be a promising tool to understand how palimpsest
                  manuscripts were constructed.},

                  practitioners are constantly developing novel strategies for
                  the analyses and interpretations of complex, degraded protein
                  mixtures. The community has also established standards of good
                  practice to interrogate our data. However, there is a lack of
                  a systematic exploration of how these affect the
                  identification of peptides, post-translational modifications
                  (PTMs), proteins and their significance (through the False
                  Discovery Rate) and correctness. We systematically
                  investigated the performance of a wide range of sequencing
                  tools and search engines in a controlled system: the
                  experimental degradation of the single purified bovine
                  beta-lactoglobulin (BLG), heated at 95 C and pH 7 for 0, 4 and
                  128 days. We target BLG since it is one of the most robust and
                  ubiquitous proteins in the archaeological record. We tested
                  different reference database choices, a targeted dairy protein
                  one, and the whole bovine proteome and the three digestion
                  options (tryptic-, semi-tryptic- and non-specific searches),
                  in order to evaluate the effects of search space and the
                  identification of peptides. We also explored alternative
                  strategies, including open search that allows for the global
                  identification of PTMs based upon wide precursor mass
                  tolerance and de novo sequencing to boost sequence coverage.
                  We analysed the samples using Mascot, MaxQuant, Metamorpheus,
                  pFind, Fragpipe and DeNovoGUI (pepNovo+, DirecTag, Novor),
                  benchmarked these tools and discuss the optimal strategy for
                  the characterisation of ancient proteins. We also studied
                  physicochemical properties of the BLG that correlate with bias
                  in the identification coverage.},

                  bones of human victims of the eruption that in AD 79 rapidly
                  buried Pompeii and Herculaneum, allowing the detection of
                  molecular signatures imprinted in the surviving protein
                  components. Bone collagen survived the heat of the eruption,
                  bearing a piece of individual biological history encoded in
                  chemical modifications. Here we show that the human bone
                  proteomes from Pompeii are more degraded than those from the
                  inhabitants of Herculaneum, despite the latter were exposed to
                  temperatures much higher than those experienced in Pompeii.
                  The analysis of the specimens from Pompeii shows lower content
                  of non-collagenous proteins, higher deamidation level and
                  higher extent of collagen modification. In Pompeii, the slow
                  decomposition of victims' soft tissues in the natural dry-wet
                  hydrogeological soil cycles damaged their bone proteome more
                  than what was experienced at Herculaneum by the rapid
                  vanishing of body tissues from intense heat, under the
                  environmental condition of a permanent waterlogged burial
                  context. Results herein presented are the first proteomic
                  analyses of bones exposed to eruptive conditions, but also
                  delivered encouraging results for potential biomarkers that
                  might also impact future development of forensic bone

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is predicted to affect
                  around 17.9 million individuals in Europe by 2060. The disease
                  is associated with severe electrical and structural
                  remodelling of the heart, and increased the risk of stroke and
                  heart failure. In order to improve treatment and find new drug
                  targets, the field needs to better comprehend the exact
                  molecular mechanisms in these remodelling processes.
                  OBJECTIVES: This study aims to identify gene and miRNA
                  networks involved in the remodelling of AF hearts in AF
                  patients with mitral valve regurgitation (MVR). METHODS: Total
                  RNA was extracted from right atrial biopsies from patients
                  undergoing surgery for mitral valve replacement or repair with
                  AF and without history of AF to test for differentially
                  expressed genes and miRNAs using RNA-sequencing and miRNA
                  microarray. In silico predictions were used to construct a
                  mRNA-miRNA network including differentially expressed mRNAs
                  and miRNAs. Gene and chromosome enrichment analysis were used
                  to identify molecular pathways and high-density AF loci.
                  RESULTS: We found 644 genes and 43 miRNAs differentially
                  expressed in AF patients compared to controls. From these
                  lists, we identified 905 pairs of putative miRNA-mRNA
                  interactions, including 37 miRNAs and 295 genes. Of particular
                  note, AF-associated miR-130b-3p, miR-338-5p and miR-208a-3p
                  were differentially expressed in our AF tissue samples. These
                  miRNAs are predicted regulators of several differentially
                  expressed genes associated with cardiac conduction and
                  fibrosis. We identified two high-density AF loci in
                  chromosomes 14q11.2 and 6p21.3. CONCLUSIONS: AF in MVR
                  patients is associated with down-regulation of ion channel
                  genes and up-regulation of extracellular matrix genes. Other
                  AF related genes are dysregulated and several are predicted to
                  be targeted by miRNAs. Our novel miRNA-mRNA regulatory network
                  provides new insights into the mechanisms of AF.},
